This repository holds code for for manuscript titled "The association between childhood social isolation and ADHD: bidirectional influences and aetiology". Analyses include random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI‚ÄêCLPM) of social isolation and ADHD symptoms at ages 5, 7, 10 and 12. Twin biometric ACE models were incorporated to assess shared aetiology of these associations. All data from the E-Risk Study. 

For greater clarity when reviewing the code and results for this manuscript, this repository has been converted into an R pages website. **The website can be accessed here: ** 

Analyses for this project were conducted in R (Version 4.0.3).
